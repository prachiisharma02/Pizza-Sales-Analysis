# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
Interactive Pizza Sales Data Analysis using SQL and Power BI

# Introduction:
This project involves analyzing pizza sales data to gain actionable insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and business trends. The analysis is performed using SQL and visualized in interactive dashboards using Power BI.

# Key Metrics Analyzed
The following KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) were calculated and analyzed:

1) Total Revenue: The total earnings from all pizza sales.
2) Average Order Value: Revenue per order, calculated as Total Revenue / Total Orders.
3) Total Pizzas Sold: The number of all pizza units sold.
4) Total Orders: The number of orders placed.
5) Average Pizzas Per Order: The number of pizzas sold per order.

# Dashboards
The Power BI dashboards include the following charts and visualizations:

1) Daily Trend for Total Orders: A bar chart showcasing fluctuations in daily order volumes.
2) Monthly Trend for Total Orders: A line chart illustrating the monthly trend in pizza orders.
3) Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category: A pie chart that shows the contribution of each pizza category to overall sales.
4) Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size: A pie chart representing sales proportions based on pizza sizes.
5) Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category: A funnel chart comparing pizza sales by categories.
6) Top 5 Best Sellers (by Revenue, Quantity, and Orders): Bar charts highlighting the highest-selling pizza items.
7) Bottom 5 Sellers (by Revenue, Quantity, and Orders): Bar charts showcasing the least popular pizza items.

# Tools & Technologies Used
1) SQL: Used for querying and cleaning the dataset, performing aggregations, and extracting key metrics.
2) Power BI: Used to create interactive dashboards and visualizations.
3) Data Visualization: Charts like bar charts, pie charts, line charts, and funnel charts are used to convey insights effectively.

# Features
1) Identification of best and worst-performing pizzas based on revenue, quantity, and total orders.
2) Understanding daily and monthly trends to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.
3) Customer preferences for pizza categories and sizes to improve menu planning.
4) Insights into peak order times and busy days for staff allocation.

# How to Use the Project
1) Download the dataset (or a sample dataset can be linked if applicable).
2) Import SQL queries into a database for data preparation.
3) Open the Power BI .pbix file for visualization.
4) Interact with the dashboards to gain business insights.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to extract meaningful business insights from pizza sales data using SQL and Power BI. It provides a robust framework for analyzing sales trends and customer preferences, which can assist in data-driven decision-making.
